    <h3>1. Overflow: Visible</h3>
    <div class="box visible-box">
       The famous fable "The Lion and the Mouse," credited to Aesop, teaches that even the smallest 
       people can have a big influence and that good deeds, no matter how small, are rarely in vain. 
       According to legend, a small mouse scuttling across a mighty lion's face once roused him from 
       his slumber.  The lion was furious and wanted to devour the mouse, but the terrified mouse pleaded 
       for forgiveness and said he would pay the lion back someday.  The lion laughed and released the mouse, 
       amused by the seemingly unfeasible claim.  The lion later roared helplessly after becoming entangled in 
       a hunter's net.The powerful king of the jungle was set free when the small mouse heard the distress calls, 
       sprinted to the trap, and then used his sharp teeth to gnaw through the thick ropes.  The strong lion thus 
       discovered that everyone has the ability to assist one another, regardless of size or strength, and that 
       mercy has its own benefits.
